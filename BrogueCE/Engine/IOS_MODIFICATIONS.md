# iOS modifications to the BrogueCE engine

The code in `BrogueCE/Engine/` is a vendored copy of the upstream **BrogueCE 1.15**
engine, compiled into the embedded `BrogueCE.framework` and driven by the iOS host
through `CEBridge.mm`. This document records iOS-specific modifications layered on
top of the vendored engine C, so the divergence from upstream stays legible and
future maintainers (human or AI) don't mistake an intentional port change for a bug.

This is the CE counterpart to `iBrogue_iPad/BrogueCode/IOS_MODIFICATIONS.md` (which
covers the separate Classic engine that ships in the app target).

## Conventions

- **Engine → host hooks are plain C functions** declared `extern` at the top of the
  engine file that calls them and **defined in `CEBridge.mm`** (inside its
  `extern "C"` block). They route to the app via the `BrogueCEHost` protocol. Each
  is a no-op when there's no host or no device support, so the engine may call them
  unconditionally. Naming: `ce*` (e.g. `cePlayerTookDamage`, `ceSetTargeting`).
- **`uiMode` is a write-only host signal.** The engine only ever *assigns*
  `uiMode` (the `CBrogueGameEvent` tablet UI mode); nothing in the engine reads or
  branches on it. It is reported to the host by `CEBridge.mm`, which uses it to
  show/hide on-screen controls. Changing which value a screen sets is therefore a
  pure UI change and cannot affect game logic.
- **Keep changes minimal and commented.** Every edit below is marked in-code with an
  `// iOS port (iBrogue):` comment so it's greppable.

## Change log

### 2026-06-06 — Title flyout marker: ASCII `<` instead of a triangle glyph

**What.** The main-menu flyout buttons (Play, View) are marked with a literal ASCII
`<` in their button text instead of the `G_LEFT_TRIANGLE` display glyph.

**Why.** `G_LEFT_TRIANGLE` maps (via `ce_glyphToUnicode`) to `U_LEFT_TRIANGLE`
(`0x25C4` / `0x1F780`), which renders through a font that doesn't carry the glyph on
every locale/device, so it showed up inconsistently. `<` is in the reliable text set
(rendered from Monaco) and always looks the same. The flyout opens to the buttons'
left, so a left-pointing marker still reads correctly.

**Where.** `MainMenu.c` `initializeMainMenuButtons` — the Play/View button text uses
` <  ...` and the two `buttons[n].symbol[0] = G_LEFT_TRIANGLE;` assignments were
removed. (`*` in button text is the symbol placeholder; with no symbol set it would
render literally, so the text uses `<` directly.)

### 2026-06-06 — On-screen Explore button: single-tap auto-explore

**What.** A single tap on the on-screen Explore button now auto-explores
immediately, instead of the desktop two-step "tap once to preview the path, tap
again to commit." Ports the Classic engine's existing fix to CE (the button
previously misfired, often needing a second tap). Keyboard `x` (a `KEYSTROKE`) is
unaffected.

**Why.** On touch, the preview-then-commit step reads as the button "not
registering." A tapped button should act like pressing its hotkey.

**Where.** `IO.c` — file-scope `static boolean exploreImmediately`; in
`mainInputLoop`, set it when the chosen button is Explore and the event is
`MOUSE_UP`; in `exploreKey`, consume it into a local `forceExplore` and OR it into
the final `proposeOrConfirmLocation(...)` guard.

### 2026-06-05 — Light haptic when the player takes damage

**What.** When the player loses HP, the engine signals the host to play a haptic,
scaled by severity: ordinary hit, a hit that leaves the player under 40% health
(the engine's own low-health-flash threshold), or a fatal blow.

**Why.** Tactile feedback for combat; the host owns the actual haptic so it can honor
the user's haptics setting and skip unsupported devices (iPad).

**Where.**
- `Combat.c` — `extern void cePlayerTookDamage(int severity);` at file top; in
  `inflictDamage`, when `defender == &player && damage > 0 && !rogue.playbackMode`,
  compute severity (fatal / under-40% / ordinary) and call it.
- Defined in `CEBridge.mm` → `BrogueCEHost playDamageHaptic:` → host.

**Gating.** Suppressed during recording playback. The host no-ops it when haptics
are off or on iPad.

### 2026-06-05 — Move the escape button aside while aiming a throw/zap

**What.** Around the targeting loop, the engine tells the host when aiming starts and
ends, so the host can move the on-screen escape button to the lower-left corner and
enable the aiming magnifier.

**Why.** During throw/zap targeting the escape button overlapped the aiming area, and
the magnifier (tap-and-hold) was otherwise suppressed outside normal play.

**Where.**
- `Items.c` — `extern void ceSetTargeting(boolean isTargeting);` at file top; in
  `chooseTarget`, `ceSetTargeting(true)` right after entering the aim loop and
  `ceSetTargeting(false)` at **both** exits (cancel and confirm).
- Defined in `CEBridge.mm` → `BrogueCEHost setTargeting:` → host.

### 2026-06-05 — No escape button on the death screen

**What.** The "You die… — press space or click to continue" screen now uses
`CBrogueGameEventInMenu` instead of `CBrogueGameEventShowEscape`.

**Why.** A tap already advances that screen, so the on-screen escape button was
redundant clutter. `InMenu` and `ShowEscape` are identical to the host except that
`InMenu` hides the escape button; touches still flow, so a tap still advances.

**Where.** `RogueMain.c` — `gameOver()`, the death "press to continue" loop.

### 2026-06-05 — Keep the full-screen title layout during the Load/Replay pickers

**What.** While the title-menu file pickers (Open saved game / View recording) are
open, keep `brogueCEAtTitle = true`; drop it to `false` only once a file is actually
opened.

**Why.** The pickers ran with `brogueCEAtTitle = false`, so the host enabled the
in-game safe-area insets and the view visibly shrank before any game had loaded.

**Where.** `MainMenu.c` — `mainBrogueJunction()`, the `NG_OPEN_GAME` and
`NG_VIEW_RECORDING` cases (set true before `dialogChooseFile`, false inside the
`openFile` success branch). `brogueCEAtTitle` is reported to the host by
`CEBridge.mm`.

## Platform functions implemented in `CEBridge.mm`

These engine-declared platform functions were upstream stubs in this port and are now
implemented in the bridge (not the engine C, but listed here for orientation):

- `listFiles` — enumerates the CE save directory for the Load/Replay pickers.
- `getHighScoresList` / `saveHighScore` — local high scores (NSUserDefaults, CE keys).
- `saveRunHistory` / `saveResetRun` / `loadRunHistory` — the lifetime game-stats
  history (NSUserDefaults, CE keys; `seed == 0` is the "reset recent stats" sentinel).

Still stubbed: `takeScreenshot`, `notifyEvent` (the latter is where CE → Game Center
score/achievement reporting would hook in; CE high scores are currently local-only).

## Adding a new CE engine tweak

1. Prefer a host hook: declare `extern void ce<Thing>(...);` at the top of the engine
   file, call it where needed (with an `// iOS port (iBrogue):` comment), define it in
   `CEBridge.mm` inside `extern "C"`, add the matching `BrogueCEHost` method, and
   forward it from `CEHost.swift` to `BrogueViewController`.
2. For control visibility, reuse `uiMode` (write-only signal) rather than adding new
   plumbing where a mode value already conveys the intent.
3. Record the change here (what / why / where / gating).
